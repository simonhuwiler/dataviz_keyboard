        A bright dot (the ball) and two bars (the paddle) – <b>«Pong»</b> is as simple as a video game can be. Not only is it called the grandfather of video games, but it was also one of the games played at the very first «eSports» tournament. In 1972, students organized the <b>«Intergalactic spacewar Olympics»</b>. First prize: A one-year subscription for the «Rolling Stone» magazine.

      Times have changed: From simple ping pong adaptations we have advanced to complex simulations. «eSports», nowadays understood as competitive sports using video games, is a thriving market. Market value in 2012: Around 130 Million Dollars. Twenty years later in 2022, it will have an estimated worth of <b>1.9 billion dollars</b>!

    <div class='chaptertext'>
      But let's focus on the athletes. <b>«The international»</b> is a well-known e-sports tournament for Valves «Dota-2»-Game where the winning teams earns fame and cash. Have a look at your keyboard. Lets say each key on your keyboard has a value of <b>250’000 dollars</b>. What you see is the total prize money at the first tournament back in 2011.

  <div id='chapter_keysafter' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
      And this was the prize money a couple of months ago: <b>34 Million dollars</b>!

  <div id='chapter_flags' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
      As always in sports competitions: If you are at the top, you can make a living out of it. The best payed players Johan Sundstein (Denmark) and Hesse Vainikka (Finland) have made <b>between six and seven million dollars</b> in their career.

  <div id='chapter_fast' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
      It may sound ridiculous making millions just by clicking and shooting. But just like other athletes, professional eSports athletes have a tough training schedule to follow. On top of that, they need to be fast. <b>Really fast</b>!

  <div id='chapter_speedtest' class='chapter active'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>

        <span class='writingtesttitle'>Write this:</span>
        <div class='textsample'>
          We dont want to conquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of earth to the frontiers of the cosmos.

    <div class='chaptertext'>
      Your writing speed is around <span id='yourwritingspeed'></span>. Look at the keyboard. This is you typing.

  <div id='chapter_speed400' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
      The measuring unit in eSports is <b>actions per minute</b> (APM). An action is selecting a unit or giving orders to your meeple. In an intense battle, the APM is around 400. Look at your keyboard. That’s how fast you would have to write to reach this speed. 
    </div>

  <div id='chapter_speed818' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
        And this is Korean player Park Sung-joon playing. He is the record holder with <b>818 APMs</b>!

      <b>AWSD</b> stands for the keys often used as the arrow keys in gaming. But <b>AWSD</b> also stands for a thriving industry, a billion-dollar market and a new form of sports competitions.

  <div id='chapter_letsplay' class='chapter'>
    <div class='chaptertext'>
      This is the end of our story. <b>Now let's play a game!</b> It’s called <b>fruit salad</b>. Healthy fruit will appear on your keyboard. But be aware of the tomatoes, they are genetically modified and will eat other fruits. Trample them (by pressing the key) before they spread! But don’t destroy the healthy fruit, they are part of your five a day!
